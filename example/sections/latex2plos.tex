\section*{\code{latex2plos} tests}

This section is not a part of the original PLOS \LaTeX~template.
It has been added to demonstrate the commonly used \LaTeX~features that are not present in the PLOS template, and verify that \code{latex2plos} is able to handle them properly.

\subsection*{\code{verbatiminput}}

\code{latex2plos.transformers.VerbatimInputTransformer} will transform a \verb|\verbatiminput| file inclusion into its equivalent \verb|\begin{verbatim}...\end{verbatim}| call, as in the example below:

\verbatiminput{../setup.py}
