\section*{\code{latex2plos} tests}

This section is not a part of the original PLOS \LaTeX~template.
It has been added to demonstrate the commonly used \LaTeX~features that are not present in the PLOS template, and verify that \code{latex2plos} is able to handle them properly.

\subsection*{\code{verbatiminput}}

\code{latex2plos.transformers.VerbatimInputTransformer} will transform a \verb|\verbatiminput| file inclusion into its equivalent \verb|\begin{verbatim}...\end{verbatim}| call, as in the example below \cite{Project:friendly_name_mixin:CodeRepository}:

\verbatiminput{listings/friendly_name_mixin.py}

\subsection*{\code{bibliography}}

\code{latex2plos.transformers.BibliographyTransformer} will transform a \verb|\bibliography| file inclusion into its equivalent \verb|\begin{thebibliography}...\end{thebibliography}| call, as demonstrated by this example paper (\code{paper.tex}) and its BiBTeX database (\code{references.bib}).

This is done as PLOS does not allow submission of BiBTeX databases, and instead requires the reference information to be embedded in the paper directly \cite{PLOS:LaTeX}.

\subsection*{\code{lstinputlisting}}

\code{latex2plos.transformers.InputListingTransformer} will copy over the files referenced by \verb|\lstinputlisting| into the papers export directory, as in the examples below:

\lstinputlisting[language=Python,caption={\code{friendly\_name\_mixin} project source code \cite{Project:friendly_name_mixin:CodeRepository}}]{listings/friendly_name_mixin.py}

\lstinputlisting[language=Python,caption={\code{friendly\_name\_mixin} project unit tests \cite{Project:friendly_name_mixin:CodeRepository}}]{listings/tests.py}
