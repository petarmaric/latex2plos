Major features
==============

Multiple LaTeX files workflow
-----------------------------

If your paper is organized into multiple ``.tex`` files, latex2plos will
combine them into a single, cohesive ``.tex`` file.

``\verbatiminput``
------------------

Transforms a ``\verbatiminput`` file inclusion into its equivalent
``\begin{verbatim}...\end{verbatim}`` call.

``\bibliography``
-----------------

Transforms a ``\bibliography`` file inclusion into its equivalent
``\begin{thebibliography}...\end{thebibliography}`` call.

This is done as PLOS does not allow submission of BiBTeX databases, and instead
requires the reference information to be embedded in the paper directly, as per
PLOS `LaTeX guidelines`_.

``\lstinputlisting``
--------------------

Copies over the files referenced by ``\lstinputlisting`` into the papers export
directory.

``\includegraphics``
--------------------

Copies over the figures referenced by ``\includegraphics`` into the papers
export directory. It will also transform all figures into the TIFF image format
(LZW compression, at 300 dpi) and remove/comment-out them from the papers
exported PDF, as per PLOS `LaTeX guidelines`_ and `figures guidelines`_.
